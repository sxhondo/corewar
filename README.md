# Corewar

Breakdown of the project’s objectives
This project can be broken down into three distinctive parts:
# The assembler
this is the program that will compile your champions and translate them from the language you will write them in (assembly language) into “Bytecode”.Bytecode is a machine code, which will be directly interpreted by the virtual
machine.
# The virtual machine
It’s the “arena” in which your champions will be executed.
It offers various functions, all of which will be useful for the battle of the champions.
Obviously, the virtual machine should allow for numerous simultaneous processes;
we are asking you for a gladiator fight, not a one-man show simulator.
# The champion 
This one is a special case. Later, in the championship, you will
need to render a super powerful champion, who will scare the staff team to death.
However, rendering this kind of champion is serious work. And since, for now, we
are mostly interested in your capacity to create Corewar’s other programs (i.e. the
assembler and virtual machine), your current champion will only need to prove to
us that you can write bits and pieces of Corewar ASM. This means that the champion you should render for this project only needs to scare the bejesus out of a
neurasthenic hedgehog.
There will also be a Corewar championship, for which you will create new champions
that will fight in a series of epic battles. The highpoint of this championship will make
Game of Thrones look like nap time at kindergarten.
Please note that the championship is a separate project for which you will render a
new champion. It would therefore be wise for you to keep your most twisted strategies to
yourself, so that you don’t become, so to speak, the laughing stock of this championship
of utmost seriousness.
